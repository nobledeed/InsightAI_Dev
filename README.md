## InsightAI

A **starter** project for Generative AI assistants enabled in a Flask web application.  

I wanted to move beyond the Langchain/Streamlit tutorials I've found and move a little closer to a production app by including Langchain agents in a Flask app. 

**Note: This is not a production-ready application.** 

The project includes:  
- 3 Langchain agent types:
    - Research agent with tools (Tavily search and Wikipedia)
    - PDF RAG agent
    - SQL agent
- HTMX Ajax calls
- LOTS of opportunities for improvement, enhancement, and refactoring!
- Responsive HTML5 template by [TEMPLATED.CO](https://templated.co)



I hope you'll find my work helpful.
